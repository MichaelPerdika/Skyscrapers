- complete check_integrity_function
- If a rule x is complete erase it or mark it as (x)? example 2 --> (2)

TODO minor tasks:
- Add help function.
- Make check to completion and add options of which depth of completion should I have. (add a "complete" arg command so the user can see the complete result)
- Add "save", "load" command. And do it with stack so I can have multiple saves that I can get with pop. 
- Add restoreall command (restores to initial state with only the rules applied)
- Add print_saved_stack command.
